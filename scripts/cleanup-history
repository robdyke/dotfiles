"""
Edits history to deduplicate, leaving the last occurrence of each command.
Filters useless entries. Also normalises whitespace.

To install, add this to .bashrc:

    trap "~/.local/bin/cleanup-history ~/.bash_history" EXIT

Advantages:
 * History only cleaned on shell exit, meaning history isn't immediately lost which can be annoying sometimes
 * De-duplication is global rather than sequential items only
 * More-powerful regexes can be used
 * Whitespace is normalised
 * Can be used with bash and zsh at the same time with coherent behavior
