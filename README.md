# Supported OSes

AKA the OSes I actively use.

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
* MacOS (~10.13 High Sierra)
* Raspbian Stretch
* ~~Raspbian Jessie~~
* ~~RHEL5~~
* ~~RHEL6~~
* ~~Ubuntu 11.10~~
* ~~Ubuntu 12.04 LTS~~
* ~~Ubuntu 14.04 LTS~~


# Software

General:

* `vim`/`neovim` : text editor
* `bash/zsh/fish` : Shells, used interchangibly depending on platform. Fish
generates completions from man pages! (but CTRL+R reverse-i-search isn't there
so I don't use it)
* `tmux` : Terminal multiplexer
* `git` : version control
* `ripgrep` : find/grep alternative for refactoring and source code exploration
* `fzf` : fuzzy list filtering used with ripgrep and vim
* `ssh` : secure remote shell (obvious I know)
* `gnupg2`: OpenPGP cryptographic suite
* `ipython` : interactive python shell
* `ansible` : idempotent, agentless configuration management
* `httpie` : curl alternative with better UX
* `jq` : Command line JSON processor (good with httpie)
* `ncdu` + `tmpreaper` : tools for clearing up disk space
* `brew` : homebrew package manager for OS X
* `brew cask` : cask bundle manager for OS X
* `restic` : backup software
* `tinc` : A reliable mesh VPN
* `taskwarrior` : todo application with contexts
* `draw.io` : Diagram software
* `tig` : Git history visualiser
* `sox`/`ffmpeg`/`gstreamer` Tools to convert multimedia
* `httrack` : a website crawler better than wget (i.e. it works)
* `gruvbox` : A calm colorscheme with good enough contrast. I moved from solarised.
* `kitty` : GPU accelerated terminal (see also: `alacritty`) Recommended font: https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro Tip: Minimise keyboard repeat delay and maximise keyboard repeat rate for a faster experience. Latency is everything.  NOTE Alacrity/kitty.  
# shell bindings

* `tm` will start or attach to the first `tmux` session. If you're on the only
  shell, `tmux` session 0 will automatically attach.
* `CTRL+p` will launch `vim` in fzf mode, also works inside vim
* `CTRL+r` history search using fzf
* `CTRL+s` will prepend `sudo` to the prompt and move the cursor to the end of the prompt
* `tryforever <cmd...>` will run a command in a loop until it fails
* `kill <tab>` will use fzf to find a process to kill
* `cd **<tab>` will use fzf to find a directory to change to
* `ssh **<tab>` will use fzf to find a host to ssh to
* history is globally shared, allowing CTRL+R search

See `home/.aliases` and `bin/` for some useful shortcuts.

As a bonus, the prompt/hostname colour changes with the hostname so it's easier
to differentiate between hosts.

# One liners

Obviously inspect the script to see what it does before you run it. Note that it
will clobber your settings files.

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/raw/master/provision.sh | bash && bash
```

Ubuntu 17.04 does not have curl by default.

```bash
wget -O - https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/raw/master/provision.sh | bash && bash
```



# Task management

I've tried quite a few TODO systems including simple text files, Todoist,
Trello, Github issues, JIRA, habitica and taskwarrior. The key is
not to use one system for everything. I've settled on:

1. Github issues for personal projects (also using the rest of github)
2. JIRA (with kanban) for work (not by choice but works well if set up with a
   good workflow, slow)
3. Taskwarrior for top level tasks and work logs, with contexts for
   home/work/inbox and detail sometimes tracked separately in (1) and (2).
   Loosely following GTD.
4. Text files to track ideas and proposals

I rely on Taskwarrior to keep a report of what I've done. I kept a log text
file for 3.5 years but stopped because taskwarrior can generate reports.

In my opinion the key for using taskwarrior effectively is reducing noise via
contexts, start/stop, scheduling and tagging. I keep a separate context for
work, home, someday; I defer tasks using the wait/schedule/due attributes. Also
I think it's important not to put tasks on the queue for the sake of it. Only
put tasks on the queue if you need to track them.
