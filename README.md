This repository contains scripts that I use to provision my new
computers/servers that I use day-to-day.

I maintain it so that I can be productive within 10 minutes of encountering a
new or re-installed PC.

| Purpose                | Tool(s)                             | Comments                                                                                                                                               |

| Code search            | [ripgrep][4] + [fzf][3]             | See `rgfzf` and `vimfzf` commands in `scripts/` and bindings below.                                                                                    |
| Version control        | [git][15]                           | GnuPG2 used for code signing. GPG agent forwarded to remote hosts with `gssh`                                                                          |

| Security device        | [Yubikey 5][13]                     | Used with [GnuPG2][14] to hold GPG keys and SSH key. Also used for 2FA.                                                                                |
| Note taking            | [git][15] + [vim][16] / [neovim][1] | I use a git repository of markdown files to organise ideas and other notes. Yet another mental offload.                                                |
| Personal cryptography  | [GnuPG2][14]                        | Used with a Yubikey. See my [set up guide.][34]                                                                                                        |
| Shell                  | [bash][7]/[zsh][8]                  | I used to use fish but it's incompatible with bourne shell which makes maintenance a pain.                                                             |

| Terminal               | [Alacritty][18]                     | GPU accelerated and minimal. I also use `uxterm.`                                                                                                      |
| Terminal Font          | [Hack][38]                          | Switched from Adobe Source Code Pro as 0 and 8 were too similar                                                                                        |
| Window management      | [i3wm][19]                          | Much faster than Unity, Gnome 3 etc as there are no animations. See openbox if you don't like tiling window managers.                                  |

# Notable features
* Workflows and application configuration profiled for speed. See section on
  Latency for more information.
* Prompt/hostname colour based on hostname to make it easy to distinguish
  between hosts.
* SSH+GPG agent runs locally, forwarded remotely. SSH_AUTH_SOCK
  is synchronised between tmux sessions.
* history is globally shared, as I use my history as a database to search
* History is automaticall filtered: History is de-duplicated, most recent persists. History
  is also filtered leaving only useful commands. This increases the SNR in the
  history file about 5x, which makes searching the history using FZF quicker.
  History is only cleaned up on shell exit, so you won't lose your immediate
  history which allows for command correction.

# Custom bindings

| Binding        | Context      | Description                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CTRL+p`       | bash/zsh/vim | Search current directory with FZF and launch editor with results. Tab to select multiple.                                                      |
| `r <string>`   | bash/zsh     | Search current directory with ripgrep for files containing `<string>`, filter with FZF and launch editor with results. Tab to select multiple. |
| `CTRL+r`       | bash/zsh     | History search using fzf.                                                                                                                      |
| `tm`           | bash/zsh     | Launch or connect tmux single session. This is automatic if there is already an unconnected session.                                           |
| `CTRL+s`       | bash/zsh     | Prepend `sudo` to the prompt and move the cursor back to the end of the prompt.                                                                |

# One liners

Obviously inspect the script to see what it does before you run it. Note that it
will clobber your settings files.

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/raw/master/provision.sh | bash && bash
```

Ubuntu 17.04 does not have curl by default.

```bash
wget -O - https://github.com/naggie/dotfiles/raw/master/provision.sh | bash && bash
```

# Latency and speed

The UI latency of modern computers has gotten progressively worse in the last
30 years despite advancement in clock speed and computing power. Worse yet, a
lot of user interfaces actually needlessly add latency by introducing pointless
animations. See <https://danluu.com/input-lag/> for an in-depth investigation,
and <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19443076> for insightful discussion.

The lowest possible latency is a target for my workflow and code in this
repository.  Too many user interfaces waste time on stupid animations or are
just generally slow; working with a setup that is perceptually instantaneous is
very pleasant and makes other systems feel irritating to use. Beyond the
configuration here, here are some other things that _may_ help reduce latency:

## Things that noticeably help
* Use an accelerated terminal such as `kitty` or `alacritty`
* Turn all animations off where possible. For example, Firefox's "cosmetic"
  animations and "smooth" scrolling.
* Profile  and optimise application startup time
* Use a SSD (preferably NVMe m.2 PCI-E based)
* Use a tiling window manager (no 3D nonsense, animations or time spent adjusting windows)
* Adjust keyboard repeat rate to the lowest setting
* Mitigate [Bufferbloat][17]

## Things that may help
* Use a monitor with low latency and high refresh rate. Again, gaming monitors
  are usually optimised for this.
* Use a keyboard with a fast polling rate and minimal debounce time. A lot of
  gaming keyboards such as the Corsair K70 are optimised for this. MX Speed
  switches may also help.

# Tips

1. Run a vim selection through a command with `:!cmd`. Useful for formatting as
   well as copying on a mac: `!pbcopy`. Write from the clipboard with
   `r!pbpaste`.
1. Keep useful local environment variables in ~/.env-local.sh

# Operational security
With major services being compromised more and more, good OPSEC is important. I use:

1. 2FA (U2F) where possible
1. A different password for every service (important to prevent attacker pivot)
1. Yubikey (as an openPGP smartcard) to store my SSH and GPG keys. See my [set up guide.][34]
1. Full-disk encryption for every device
1. Lock-screen for every device
1. Backup 2FA codes, backup passwords and master passwords are in a physical fire safe
1. I may switch to a password manager (pass or Keepassxc)
1. UBlock origin on Firefox
1. HTTPS everywhere on Firefox
1. Own web services configured with A+ rating from ssllabs (best cipher suite, protocol etc)
1. Regular updates of all software
1. Subscription to vulnerability mailing lists
1. Don't forward SSH/GPG agent by default

# LiveCD

On an ubuntu host, run `remaster-livecd.sh` with an xubuntu ISO to produce a
remastered xubuntu LiveCD with dotfiles preinstalled. I use this preconfigured
with `./install-naggie.sh` to allow me to start using new or foreign PCs immediately.

It will soon be replaced with an arch equivalent.


# Mode of operation

Dotfiles can provision a fresh install of an OS, or build a live/install CD. In
order to manage the combinatorial complexity of supporting so many platforms,
the install process has been changed to the following:

1. `bootstrap` -- Installs git and ensures the repository exists. Can operate
   independently from this repository. Uses sudo Detects platform and executes
   all of the next steps:
1. `install-dependencies` -- Installs dependencies for the given platform
1. `system-configuration` -- Configures global system settings for all users
   for the given platform, eg keyboard layout. A UK keyboard and timezone is
   assumed.
1. `user-configuration` -- Installs generic user-specific configuration. No
   root required from now on.
1. `user-configuration-naggie` -- Patches user configuration with configuration
   specific to my identity

There are 2 more scripts:

1. `arch-create-livecd`: will enter a chroot environment and run `bootstrap` as
   above.
1. `arch-make-rootfs`: creates a fully provisioned rootfs for the installer script.
1. `arch-install`: will install to a given hard drive interactively using a
   prepared `rootfs` tar archive.
